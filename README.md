Code files for research on tropical linear systems with Professor Vladimir Podolskii. Some of the code in the file(s) might be unrefined.

Current algorithms implemented:
- Grigoriev's Algorithm
- Akian-Gaubert-Guterman Algorithm
- parallelized combination of both

The algorithms used for TLS-Algorithms.cpp are derived from the following papers: 
- https://logic.pdmi.ras.ru/~grigorev/pub/tropical_solution.pdf
- http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~gaubert/PAPERS/220_462.pdf
