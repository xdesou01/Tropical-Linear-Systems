Code files for informal research with Professor Vladimir Podolskii on algorithms that solve tropical linear systems. Some of the code might be unrefined (dubious formatting, redundant procedures, poor modularity, etc).

Current algorithms implemented:
- Grigoriev's Algorithm
- Akian-Gaubert-Guterman Algorithm
- Parallelized combination of both

The algorithms used for TLS-Algorithms.cpp are derived from the following papers: 
- https://logic.pdmi.ras.ru/~grigorev/pub/tropical_solution.pdf
- http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~gaubert/PAPERS/220_462.pdf
